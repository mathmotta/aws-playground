## Docker Components

### Docker CLI

Docker CLI provides developers a way to interact with Docker through Commandline Interface (CLI). Commands such as start, stop can be used in CLI. Docker provides commands to manage the complete lifecycle of containers.

Commands start with 'docker'. e.g. `docker run` or `docker create`.

### Docker daemon

Installed in host machine, acts as the brain of Docker. Creates and manages docker images in our behalf . It executes the logic behind the commands that are issued. If we write `docker stop` to a container, the daemon will find that container and stop it. It also provide access to containers


### Image registry

Place to store docker images. Allows to push/pull containers as needed. Registries can be public, or private shared among a team. We can get images from Dockerfiles.
