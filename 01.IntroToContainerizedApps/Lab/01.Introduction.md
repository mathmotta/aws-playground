# Introduction

You're a technical trainer, brought in to train a team of engineers on how to use container technology on AWS.

You know they use Python for some basic internal applications. 

Goals:
1. Show the basics of docker and basic docker commands using the standard Cloud9 environment.
2. As the commands are shown, you will progressively be building out a container, tagging it in the repository like Amazon ECR
3. Deployment of the Flask app container to the cloud with Elastic Beanstalk

The simple Flask app is in the Code Resources folder.
