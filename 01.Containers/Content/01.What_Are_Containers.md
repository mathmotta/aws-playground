# What are Containers?

## Containers vs. Virtualization

In a typical VM, the virtualization is mimicking a hardware environment. Each VM has its own OS, resources and internal components needed by apps that will be running. This gives a lot of control, but each application will need its own full operating system and hardware allocation shared from the host.

With containerization, there's an additional layer of virtualization on top of the guest OS. Different virtualized containers, can share a same OS and even binaries and drivers to cut operational overhead. So the instatiation is much lighter since it only has the necessary components. The applications are still isolated. Images in cointainers are focused only on what they need.

# Containerization Terms

## Container

Overall package and virtualized environments to be used. Applications run inside the containers. Everything it needs, from dependencies to environment variables, is packaged inside the containers. Allows to isolate the enviroment for the application that is needed to run.

Each application has its own container. To launch a container, everything needed, like dependencies, needs to be defined inside the container. This definition is captured in a __dockerfile__, which can be built into an image.

It's basically a running instance of an image.

## Images

Readonly packaged configuration to run/deploy. Blueprint of the container.

## Registry

Where images are stored. Similar to source code repository.
