# Elastic Beanstalk

Easy to use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with various languages and application servers.

No infrastructure need to be provisioned or managed to get code hosted on EC2. Core only needs to be uploaded and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing and auto scaling to application health monitoring. Underlying resources can be accessed at any time.

Elastic Beanstalk also manages the application stack for us, so no time is spent to develop the expertise.

Applications are scaled up and down automatically on its specific need using auto-scaling settings
