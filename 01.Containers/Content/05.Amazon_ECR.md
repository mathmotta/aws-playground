# Amazon Elastic Container Registry

Registires are repositories for images. When an image is in the registry, others can download.

ECR is a managed AWS Docker Registry service that is secure, scalable and reliable. It supports docker private repositories with resource-based permissions using AWS IAM, so that specific users or VM's can access repositories and images.
