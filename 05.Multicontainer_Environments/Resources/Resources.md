There is a somewhat common phrase: “Microservices don't solve complexity, they just take it out of the codebase and into the network”. This is very true. We encourage customers to move to microservices to help scale an organization. With microservices, teams can develop, release, deploy and scale services independently - thus greatly reducing the burden of change control in most cases - but what you gain in organizational scaling, you often pay for in other areas.

With microservices, you have different development teams writing services in multiple programming languages, and deploying to different technologies (containers, serverless, VMs etc.) - all within the same organization!

One of the most common questions from organizations moving to microservices (or even those already running them) is “How do I get observability into all of my services?”. They want to see at a high level what's working well, what's not working, and then have the ability to dive deeper when problems occur.

 

This is the problem App Mesh solves.  Take a look at the linked videos for an extended introduction and deep dive to App Mesh, as well as the public roadmap for the service on Github.

You can also use AWS X-Ray to increase observability for microservice architectures. Read more about AWS X-Ray here: https://aws.amazon.com/xray/
