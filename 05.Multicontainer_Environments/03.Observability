# Observability

Container host changes. Why:

1. Component failure
2. Retiring old infrastructure or software
3. Scaling up or down

This means difficulties tracking down issues within the system.

In order to track down issues, we need to verify logs with monitoring tools.

## Monitoring

It's a constant action, something we do.

1. Collect metrics
2. Collect logs
3. Watch network traffic

When something goes wrong, automatic alerts goes to someone or something to try to remediate the problem.

So monitoring is the act of collecting data. What type of data, what we with it and its availability is a different story. This is where observability comes to play.

## Observability

It's __not__ something we do. Instead, is more of a property of a system. A system can be observable, or not. An observable system allows us to measure how well the internal workings of the system are from the output of that same system.

### Tracing software

Allows to understand the flow of our service. 

With microservices, we have services calling each other to perform a singular task. Tracing then allows us to collect the data on the calls between services, measure performance of each individual service, and view the system as a whole regarding latency between those services.

### AWS R-Ray

Allows us to achieve observability. Collects data about requests that application serves and provide us with tools to view, filter and gain insight into that data.
