# Monolithic Applications

Not entirely bad, but an anti-pattern. Hard to scale and adapt quickly. I tshows limitations when looking at the scalability and reliability of the app.

For example, a photo sharing app: Functional parts are user verification, user profile, photo viewing, photo uploading and photo editing.

# One server to rule them all

First, worst possible way to do this: All in one server. Each part of the application need different resources, but to scale it, the whole application has to scale. Adding more resources pretty much means a whole new server.

# De...Coupling?

Version 2 there is some decoupling. User profile data is stored off server. Raw photos are still stored in servers together with processing. It's a workable solution, but there are ways to improve

# Microservices

WIth microservices, each part is scalable on its own. Changes can be done only to needed parts, and if one is down, replacements can be used while its being fixed. Containers fit very well with microsevices
