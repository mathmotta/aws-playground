# Persistent Storage

By default, storage used by containers is not consistent. They are by natural ephemeral.

Images are made of stackable layers which help deploy changes quickly and effectively.

These layers, combine with a top container layer to make up what we call the container.


To have persistent data with containers, data needs to be externalized and persisted outside of the container and not applied as the container layer.

## Solutions

### Bind mount

Or mounts for short, it's a file or folder stored anywhere on the container host filesystem and mounted into a running container.

When using it, we need to set a flag when mounting the container, and specify the source folder on the container host.

### Volumes

Volumes are stored by host filesystem but managed by the container agent. It is the prefered method.
