# Key Concepts

## Cluster

Logical isolation boundary for the insfrastructure that hosts the containers. Lives inside virtual private network, can span multiple AZ(availability zones)

## Tasks and Services

To run containers, we will create tasks and services. These services will then place the tasks on our cluster. A task is just a wrapper to run our containers in. To run a task, we need to create a task definition, which is just a configuration to what container(s) are goin to be run.

Task definition includes:

1. Image and tag
2. Memory
3. VPCU
4. Ports
5. Shared Volumes if needed

Apps can span multi task definition.

After having a task definition, we will then configure a service that runs a task based on that task definition. It allows conifugring the number of tasks to run and maintain across the cluster. Define if we want to front the service with a load balancer or not as well as what subnets and security groups we want tasks to use.
