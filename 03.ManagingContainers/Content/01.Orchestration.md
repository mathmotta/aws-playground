# Orchestration

Having multiple containers means being resilient. We need to spread our application across instance hosts

Containers are great for increased application load and scaling out and in.

Therefore, we need containers to integrate with

1. Networking
2. Storage and DB
3. Logging

## Container orchestration platforms

Handles spinning containers up and down, making sure to wire up networking to spec, handling permissions and providing integrations, centralizes logging and monitoring, etc.
