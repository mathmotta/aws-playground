# ECS Components

To prepare an app to run on ECS, we create what is called a task definition. A JSON file that describes one or more containers that for our application, with a max of 10.

Essentiall, a blueprint for deployment.

## Task Definition

Task definitions are used to specifiy various parameters for our application, including the container to use, launch type, ports, data volumes etc.


## Task

Task itself is the instantiation of a task definition within a cluster. 

## Scheduler

Places tasks on the cluster. Several options: can define a service that runs and mantains a specified number of tasks simultaneously, manually run tasks, schedule tasks, and use custom schedulers with ECS.


## Cluster

Logical grouping of compute resources; Depending on lunch type, they can be managed for us with Fargate or by us with EC2

## Service

Run and maintain specified nubmer of instances of a task definition simultaneously; Can be run behind a load balancer, allow us to specify deployment configurations, and can be deleted which will stop all running tasks associated

## Container Agent

Runs on each compute node within ECS cluster. Sends info about resources current running tasks and utilization to ECS. Also start/stop tasks whenever requested from ECS.
