# Scaling with Kubernetes

Technologies to be aware of

## Cluster Autoscaler

Standalone program, adjust size of cluster to meet demand. 

Adjust under two conditions:

If pods fail to run due to insufficient cluster resources. Nodes are added to the cluster.

Underutilized nodes on cluster, pods can be moved to other nodes. Nodes are then removed from cluster.

Cluster autoscaler integrates with AWS Auto Scaling groups, but doesnt support cros AZ 

## Horizontal pod autoscaler

Given the metric source, it will scale number of pods as part of deployment, controller or replica set.

Metric source is called Kubernetes metrics server, not deployed in EKS by default, bu tcan be download in Github. it aggregates data about resource utilization in cluster

## Custom Metris API

Vertical pod autoscaler requires deploy metrics server to server, but it doesnt adjust the number of pods, but the CPU and memory of pods. When properly sizing a pod, we avoid over provisioning resources and improve cluster resource utilization

When using kubernetes in AWS, we will use kubernetes-specific scaling mechanisms
